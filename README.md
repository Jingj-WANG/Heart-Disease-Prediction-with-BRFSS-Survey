Project: Heart Disease Prediction with BRFSS Survey

## Background
The most horrible Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), heart disease, is now one of the leading causes of death around the world. There are many risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, high BMI, lack of exercise, etc. Among those, the first three are the key risk factors; and about half of all Americans have at least one of them according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

This project takes the dataset from CDC to build machine learning models which could predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease. The data are taken from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) which annually organizes surveys regarding of basic health status of U.S. residents. A direct quote from the CDC is: "Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.‚Äù

## Operation
Here our team took the newest data, which are from 2020, to analyze and learn from. Specifically, we constructed five classification machine learning models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, Ada Boosting and Decision Tree techniques. Then we tuned hyperparameters, selected best model, evaluated its performance and conducted feature importance analysis. The findings of the project could not only serve as a method to predict the existence of a heart disease, but also educate doctors, nurses, researchers and potential patients to focus more on certain factors and take precautions in advance.
